# Rebuilding deepthtot with ProxMox

## Current State

There was a hard drive failure and during recovery all of the VMs were lost on the SAN. They may be recoverable, but
that's unknown at this time.

Regardless I've been wanting to switch to ProxMox for a long time now, so I'm going to do this.

Converting to ProxMox

1. Get the HP up and running on kvm slot 1.
2. Watch ProxMox videos
3. Install ProxMox on HP
4. Get familiar with ProxMox
1. Set up backups
5. Move ssd VMs onto HP
    1. Move Services
    2. Move IPA
    3. Move other stuff, whatever exists
1. After everything seems to be working um, bite the bullet, maybe
    1. Install proxmox on sandisk ssd
    2. Run it on old machine
    3. Try joining it to cluster
    4. Migrate a test machine to it from the HP
    5. Dump an image of the current drive onto the SAN
    1. Clone services, IPA, etc onto supermicro
    1. shut down the VMs on the HP and ensure the supermicro works
    1. bring the HP VMs back up
    1. stop the SM with ssd
    1. install proxmox onto the SM
    1. repeat the migrations etc
    1. test everything
    1. if there's a failure recover the image from the SAN
5. Get Plex working
7. Get torrent working/rebuild torrent
6. Get Mastodon Working
8. Get Mail Server Ready
9. Create the dmz machines
1. Basic system is configured
    1. K8S
    1. DNS
    1. CertMonger
    1. S3 server
    1. gitlab
    1. migrate mail and mastodon to k8s

## ProxMox notes

ProxMox is really cool, I mean really. It basically serves the same purpose as vsphere except it's all open source and
brodcom can kiss my fat transgender ass. This is why you never, ever trust closed source for anything useful.  (do you
hear that plex???)

Anyway, this is what I've done, I
watched [LearnLinuxTV's proxmox course on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5j0Zb6x_hOk&list=PLT98CRl2KxKHnlbYhtABg6cF50bYa8Ulo)
It's pretty good, a little slow and repetitive, but it gave me a really good feel for how to proxmox. I've been kinda
working along with it to do my actual server.

The server is my old HP proliant, it has a 4 x AMD A12-9800 RADEON R7, 12 COMPUTE CORES 4C+8G, I'm not sure what that
means, if it has 12 compute cores how is there only 4 cores? Regardless, it's big enough for my purposes. What my
purposes are is set this thing up to be the minimal system, what is still surviving namely, services, ipa, awx,
backup/and it looks like plex?

The system came up just peachy, I'm loving it. I need to get into the habit of creating template disks, in fact I'll
probably use ansible for it. The idea is to have a 'golden' image, yeah, I know I always said that wasn't a good idea,
however without a fast package cache (when let's face it, nexus is most certainly not) installing a system from bare
metal is just too friggin slow. That said, I think a big part of it is how slow my san is, that needs to be addressed,
but when I have money.

I'm thinking it may be good to put an ssd on my main server and build the VMs there then migrate them to another drive.
Yes, I can do this with proxmox, it doesn't have all of ESXi's stupid money grubbing limitations.

So, as I was saying, after getting the proliant to boot, which was a very frustrating day followed by getting it done
almost immediately the next day. Installing proxmox was really easy, it probably doesn't need explanation, however
basically you transfer it to a thumb drive (I had to track down software to do this, but I've forgotten what it was and
don't feel like looking it up now), then booting the thumb drive, and use that to do the install, which as I said was
super straight forward.

After that I started kicking the tires, I watched the aformentioned video series and worked along with it. Create a VM,
turn it into a template, spin up several more and that's it.

Now, one caveat, I really don't like how Jay's method of preparing a machine works. When it comes time, this is what I
want:

Using cloud-init, the machine's name should be available in a variable. Use that, then get cloud-init to be set up to do
it's whole thing on the next boot. I think that just consists of blowing away everything (ssh keys, logs, machine-id,
etc) and finally erasing a file that causes cloudinit to run. I think that may be a u 13.10 thing though, I'm not
finding it on my current machines.

TODO: Figure out how Ubuntu 22.04 and earlier cause cloud-init to only run completely on the first boot.

I need to know more about cloud init, it's the missing piece of cleanly bringing up a new vm autonomously. Fabulous!
I've always wanted something like it.

This has gone on too long... My plan for today is:

1. Sometime during the day rsync hg2t2g volume1 to the external drives. It'll probably take longer than a day, if that's
   the case play wow until it's done :-)
1. Move the VMs.  [docs](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Migrate_to_Proxmox_VE) use ovftool on esx and qm importovf on
   pve.<br>
   NOTE: a side note, it would be cool to have the proxmox machine id = the last tuple of the address
1. Do it again because I know I'll learn stuff while doing it the first time.<br>
   NOTE: there's a cloud-init disk in the system, that may be useful for this.
1. If everything seems to be working, shut down the original machines and bring the new ones on-line.<br>
   NOTE: track down how pve is defined, clearly it's from the last install see what it is and make the HP be pve.
1. Let it run overnight

Tomorrow:

1. Back up the old machine
1. Install proxmox on heartogold. Maybe onto the sandisk if I'm squeemish.
1. Join it with the HP
1. Migrate the machines to it.

NOTE: yeah, I definitely should do a dry run with the USBSSD I have.

Well, I fell into the youtube black hole... I'm trying to rememver who I saw with the command that allows you to take
standard images and add packages to them.  (like emacs and ipa-client)
Still having issues. I can't seem to find the application I ran across yesterday to add deb packages to an img file...
waste of time.

I've been unable to transfer IPA to proxmox, it just doesn't work. The test machine worked fine, I'm suspecting it's the
centos instead of ubuntu. I'm ls

2/15/2 today I got services over. IPA is a problem, I don't know if it's centos related or joy related. Moving services
involved editing /etc/netplan/01-network-manager-all.yaml which has the fixed ID and ethernet device in it. I'm hoping
this is because it has a fixed IP. Which reminds me *always* use DHCP to assign addresses. Use a MAC if you want static
assignments.

2/18/24 I've been remiss of keeping this stuff updated, what I should do is write everyting down as I do it and then
edit it down.
anyway...

### transferring a debian VM from esxi to pve

1. ssh into the pve machine
1. If you haven't downloaded ovftool do so now, it's easy to find with google, who knows if broadcom will keep it
   working or not.
1. run ./ovftool vi://<ESXi server>/<machine name>
    * On deepthot the ESXi is 192.168.42.3. 1=router 2=dns/dhcp 3=hypervisor 4=DNS/certs/LDAP/kerberos aka AD or IPA
1. qm importovf ASSET# <path to ovf file> <store to create machine on>  (right now that would be local-lvm and
   h2gt2g-hosts)
1. add a nic to the machine
1. boot it up, get root and: rm cloud.cfg.d/subiquity-disable-cloudinit-networking.cfg
1. reboot
1. I'm sparked
1. if it's joined to the network go into ipa and change the a record to match what the machine is now

Now, this is on 20.04. I'm hoping 22.04 didn't have the issue where the cloud config file needed removing. I know this
didn't happen while I was running services.

### transferring a centos 7 vm from esxi to pve

Not nearly as clean, when I tried the ovftool the imported machine just sucked. Fortunately

1. get a copy of
   rescuzilla [download](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/releases/download/2.4.2/rescuezilla-2.4.2-64bit.jammy.iso)
1. boot the machine you want to transfer with it
1. clone the drive actually the vm
1. boot the machine you want to move it to with rescuezilla
1. install the clone
1. reboot and it works

The A record may be wrong sometimes when the machine comes up. Just put the new ip into the a record in ipa.

## awx

Awx almost worked when I transferred it. The main problem was it had a different ethernet address which didn't work with
the dns stuff used by IPA. So, I changed DNS entry by hand and now it's cool.

Testing to make sure it works:

1. --spin up an image on proxmox--
2. --edit the hosts.ini file to add it--
1. --try running the playbook locally--
1. repeat the above except using awx

wow, that took awhile, but the local ansible runner once I got it running worked flawlessly. AWX is more problematical.

It's taking me awhile to get awx to run a new inventory. I don't want to do the old one because of so many machines, I
just want one that's clean. Unfortunately I don't think I know or rather remember how to make a new inventory and use it
on an arbitrary system running an arbitrary job. awx. is, as always confusing as fuck to me. Actually, not too bad if
you do it by hand. AWX... probably more trouble than it's worth for something I'm only doing once.

I've got the proxmox backup server (pbs) installed, it was pretty straight forward since it's almost like proxmox. The
only thing that confused me is that 'backing store' means where the place you want to do your backups is mounted. Right
now that's h2gt2g which is kinda useless. but I've mounted in the fstab 192.168.42.7:/volume1/pbs to /mnt/h2gt2g

So for today I'm going to migrate the blueray machine, and I think that's all. Then I'm going to install proxmox to the
ssd thumbdrive I have and try to boot it. I'm not quite ready to overwrite esxi, scary, you know?

Oh, I also got backups set up for the vms. we'll see how other vms handle it when they've got more on them than services
and ipa.

I fell down the vlan rabbit hole. This is a big project and I need to stop dwelling on it....

So, 'blueray' the machine that has the blueray and all of the usb backup drives on it has been difficult. To the best of
my knowledge qm doesn't like btrfs disks. That machine was made when I still thought btrfs was a good idea.  (It is, but
it isn't tolerant of losing power. I've had several die, that was how I lost my first k8s nodes and all the cool stuff I
had set up in 2019)  Anyway, to import it I did this:

1. create a ext4 disk with a boot partition and an lvm partition with one drive full
1. mount it on /mnt and the boot on /mnt/boot
1. rsync -xHAXavS / /mnt
1. mount -obind /proc /mnt/proc
1. repeat the previous for /dev, /sys.
1. run lvmetad
1. chroot /mnt
1. I think grub install /dev/sdc or whatever the drive is. I had to futz around a bit so it might not be that, it might
   be apt install --reinstall 'the current kernel package' or dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc. One of those got it done.
1. use rescuezilla to make an image of the new drive
1. make a drive on proxmox of the same size
1. boot the proxmox machine with rescuezilla
1. restore the image above to the new drive

Note to self: one of the main things that was keeping me from working yesterday is the machine blueray had 8 cores. It's
only powered up when it's doing things like ripping dvds or backing up onto the external drives.

Note: If you make a ZFS filesystem, then delete it, the ZFS partitions will remain on the disks. This causes them not to
be found if you start the zfs allocator again. This is proxmox, not trunas

Note: Ansible doesn't like symbolic links for group_vars files.

Note: You must configure the VM in 3 steps. 1: clone, 2: set the attributes, 3: resize the disk

That's where I am now. What I'm going to do next is to snapshot the machine. Boot it and see if it's working. It won't
work completely because it's now running on the hp where the usb drives are not. I may have to boot it in rescue mode
and edit /etc/fstab to remove the usb drives. Anyway, see if it boots. When it does, install qemu-guest-agent, take
another snapshot. Then upgrade the ubuntu to 22.04, might have to do 20.04 first. It's on 18.04 which is unsupported
nowadays.

Oy vey... I'm getting a lot of grief from cloud-init, I think I better learn it. Anyway, blueray is doneish. It will
need to be reconfigured after it is placed on the supermicro.

## Installing proxmox on supermicro

The next step is to install proxmox on the supermicro. Just because I'm paranoid I'm going to configure proxmox on
sandisk thumb ssd. Create some machines, move them back and forth etc. When the final move happens this should be a copy
rather than a move. If everything works the next thing is to install proxmox on the supermicro for real.

This will involve creating a cluster on proxmox, joining the supermicro to it, play with it, unjoin it, then do the
install and the final join.

Well... As soon as proxmox started to boot it said there was a firmware bug in the processor and it needed a firmware
patch. Then it stopped booting, and now it won't boot at all anymore. I'm glad I made sure everything was off of it.
So.... total failure at the moment, I'll try to get the machine back.

## Investigating pxe boot provisioning machines all the way to configuration.

Since I'm on the old game machine I can't really do any k8s or plex at the moment. Instead I'm going to play with images
and investigate pixe booting with the machine catching it and configuring it the rest of the way with ansible.

What I did was install netboot.xyz. It's a wonderful little tftp server, you boot it and then it has a huge list of
bootable CDs. Install disks for every linux under the sun, rescue disks, everything. This would be fantastic when I'm
trying to recover a machine where I have to track down the rescue disk and burn it, then boot the machine. Fah... Now
any machine on the network I just pxeboot it and all the media you want is there.

But I've not got it working to configuration yet. What I need at this point is for awx to be able to see the newly
booted machine. I've got this great script that makes groups for everything. I've been unable to convince awx to use it
as a dynamic inventory, but it works great on ansible-playbook from the cli. Still investigating.

## New machine arrived.

It's wonderfuly, kinda short on drive space, but that just means it's the same size as the san. I'm trying to figure out
how to partition it. It does have two SSDs, but they're not the same size so they can't be raided.

The old machine is still dead, although I haven't tried it in awhile. I'm planning on opening it up and figuring how how
to reset it, removing the cmos battery for a long while might do the trick.

I spent many hours trying to get proxmox on it. I finally gave up on uefi and did a bios boot on it. That worked, from
the thumb drive. I'm not sure if the PXI boot would work now that I understand.

Anyway, proxmox is up and running. I've named it eddie (the shipboard computer).

## Migrating machines to eddie

Oh the hp is called pve, which is the default. I'm hoping heartogold will come back. But henceforward I'll call the
machines by their names.

Currently h2gt2g is up and running, but the vms are all on pve's local disk. So, the next step is

1. [x] Migrate the hard drives from pve to h2gt2g
   1. [x]Migrate the machines to eddie
   1. [x]Migrate the hard drives to eddie's boot disk

## Pihole

I installed pihole on a really too big for it VM. I should probably use debian for it. Anyway, the only issue was it
wants to have
port 53, and systemd_resolver of course has it up. When you take it down obviously resolv.conf goes away.

So, delete resolve.conf and insert the following:

'''
nameserver 127.0.0.1
options edns0 trust-ad
search deepthot.aa deepthot
'''

Came up cleanly, the best place to get blacklists is:  https://firebog.net it has a ton of lists of varying qualities.

# Set up Deepthot

I've spent a ton of time trying to get k3s up the way I want it. How I want it is for the dhcp to be the source of
truth. I may still do that, but
having IPs handed out by dhcp just isn't working. They keep getting released and I can't get the cluster up at all. So,
we're going to just use
dhcp for non server things.

## MAC addresses

There are 4 locally administered MAC address ranges. Bit 2 of the 1st tuple flags it as local. Specifically they are
2,6,A,E. I'm going to try to use 2, but if there's too many things using it I'll switch to one of the others. Right now
I have:

| value | Use         |
|-------|-------------|
| 02    | VMs         |
| 12    | k8s Ingress |

Note: This is all obsolete. I never got around to mucking with the MAC addresses much.

## IP Map

| MAC               | IP    | Name        | Purpose                  |
|-------------------|-------|-------------|--------------------------|
| 48:a9:8a:19:79:f4 | 1     | router      | duh                      |
| bc:24:11:3a:63:27 | 2     | services    | dhcp, ns                 |
| ac:1f:6b:48:87:02 | 3     | heartogold  | main host                |
| bc:24:11:b6:14:25 | 4     | ipa         | kerberos,ldap, automount |
| ec:8e:b5:d7:81:13 | 5     | pve         | second host              |
| 00:80:87:b2:1a:af | 6     | printer     | duh                      |
| 00:17:88:4c:de:9e | 7     | h2gt2g      | SAN                      |

| bc:24:11:f5:bd:16 | 15    | dmz         | dmz                      |
|                   | 20-29 | k8s cluster |                          |
|                   | 20    | k8s         | shared API               |
| 12:00:00:00:00:21 | 21    | k8s-cont-1  | Control Node 1           |
| 12:00:00:00:00:22 | 22    | k8s-cont-2  | Control Node 2           |
| 12:00:00:00:00:23 | 23    | k8s-cont-3  | Control Node 3           |
| 12:00:00:00:00:26 | 25    | k8s-work-1  | Worker Node 1            |
| 12:00:00:00:00:26 | 26    | k8s-work-2  | Worker Node 2            |

This isn't working. I've been unable to force the MAC on the VM. The IP on the other hand works.

I just heard about glass isc dhcp monitor/sorta editor. https://github.com/Akkadius/glass-isc-dhcp  Trying it out
sometime.

## k3s Set Up

Yet another attempt at k3s. My last sticking point is I just can't get dhcp selected addresses to work. You can see from
the table above
what I'm thinking of. I don't think I'll have to muck with dhcp to make this work, just set up the mac,ip,and name.

## get new awx up

I is very easy to set up AWX on a k8s cluster. It just takes a couple of files and one command:

```yaml
mkdir -p awx
  cat <<EOF >awx/kustomization.yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
  - github.com/ansible/awx-operator/config/default?ref=2.14.0
  - awx.yaml

images:
  - name: quay.io/ansible/awx-operator
    newTag: 2.14.0

namespace: awx
  EOF

  cat <<EOF >awx/awx.yaml
---
apiVersion: awx.ansible.com/v1beta1
kind: AWX
metadata:
  name: awx
spec:
  service_type: nodeport
  nodeport_port: 30080

---
apiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1
kind: IngressRoute
metadata:
  name: awx
  namespace: awx
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: traefik-external
spec:
  entryPoints:
    - websecure
  routes:
    - match: Host(`awx.local.deepthot.org`)
      kind: Rule
      services:
        - name: awx-service
          port: 80
  EOF

  kubectl apply -k awx
```

`watch kubectl -n awx get awx,all,ingress,secrets,pv,pvc` is nice to watch the progress.

and `kubectl -n awx logs -f deployments/awx-operator-controller-manager` is good for watching what's going on.

This takes a *long* time. Go off and do something.

After it's done the admin password can be displayed with
`kubectl get secret awx-admin-password -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 --decode&&echo`

ToDo: document creating traefik and cert-manager

### Dynamic Proxmox Inventory

First thing you do after installing awx is to log in and create a project. That's about half way down the menu. You'll
need a git repository to write your playbooks in. If you use git instead of http, you'll need to put a credential in. I
ended up adding several credentials just cause I was there.

You'll also need to create a custom credential type like this:

input configuration:

```yaml
fields:
  - id: username
    type: string
    label: Username
  - id: password
    type: string
    label: Password
    secret: true
required:
  - username
  - password
```

injector configuration:

```yaml
env:
  PROXMOX_USER: '{{ username }}'
  PROXMOX_PASSWORD: '{{ password }}'
  PROXMOX_USERNAME: '{{ username }}'
```

I am using two variables for the user because I've seen documentation that said both are used.

This is what pulls out the information. One of the cool things about it is you use tags to mark what kind of machine
this is with what features. For instance is it going to have docker? Kubernetes? Join the ipa, etc.

```yaml
cat <<EOF >inventory.proxmox.yaml
plugin: community.general.proxmox
validate_certs: false
want_facts: true
url: https://pve.local.deepthot.org:8006
compose:
  ansible_host: proxmox_agent_interfaces[1]["ip-addresses"][0].split('/')[0]
  ansible_user: ansible
keyed_groups:
  - key: proxmox_tags_parsed
    separator: ""
    prefix: "tag_"
cache: true
cache_plugin: memory
  EOF
```

## Plex

I found this blog https://www.derekseaman.com/2023/04/proxmox-plex-lxc-with-alder-lake-transcoding.html
which referenced this script bash -c "$(wget -qLO - https://github.com/tteck/Proxmox/raw/main/ct/plex.sh)"
So, I'm using it, we'll see if that works. It did work, however I didn't like how it worked, so I did my own.

It still needs revisiting,

1. it needs to be a VM rather than a CT.
1. the iommu stuff doesn't seem to be working, so hardware transcode isn't there.
1. I used apt-key, this needs to be redone the current way
1. I want to configure plex with ansible, but that looks to be a fairly large bit of work, putting it of 'till later.
1. The local shows are not configured anymore. I need to set it up, and of course I'll configure it here.

It's working pretty well, still speed issues. I want my old computer back.

This is all done and there's an ansible playbook to create the machine

## Torrent

Ansible script that spins up a vm, joins our domain, installs torrent and openvpn, configures them, installs filebot,
and configures it.

At this point plex works the same way it did with regards to torrent. Copy/paste a magnet, it's downloaded, and put into
the library correctly.

I've also installed sonarr, radarr, and prowlarr. These will be revisited when I get them automated. Plans are to put
them all into the k8s cluster.

These are very DB heavy, a local disk is important.

docker run -d \
--name sonarr \
-p 8989:8989 \
-e PUID=2000 \
-e PGID=1847800012 \

## Rancher

I'm using
the [rancher documentation](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/install-upgrade-on-a-kubernetes-cluster)

First install the single node k3s. This needs to be called 'rancher' because there is an inventory file with the
variables specific to that machine's name.

`ansible-playbook -i inventory/inventory.proxmox.yaml create_rancher.yaml`

There's several things set here, the ip for the cluster is .129, for instance. Check out the inventory host variables.

```bash
helm repo add rancher-latest https://releases.rancher.com/server-charts/latest
helm repo update
helm upgrade -i rancher rancher-latest/rancher \
  --namespace cattle-system \
  --create-namespace \
  --set hostname=rancher.local.deepthot.org \
  --set bootstrapPassword=admin \
  --set ingress.tls.source=rancher \
  --set letsEncrypt.email=denebeim+efs@deepthot.org \
  --set letsEncrypt.ingress.class=traefik
```

# VPN

## Wireguard

Hopefully a quick hack here. I'm trying out [wg-easy](https://github.com/wg-easy/) It looks easy peasy. I'm starting out
with a small vm with only docker installed. This is my dmz, I'm hoping what I'm trying here is really good from a
security pov. Namely it only has the ability to log into with ssh certs, of which there are no private key pairs on the
machine. It all has to be done with an agent.

Now that I think of it, I'm wondering if I'm even going to need this with wireguard. Set up the VPN and see everything.
Dunno. Let's try.

Setting up wg-easy:
copy the deployments/wg-easy/docker-compose.yaml to somewhere on the dmz
cd to that directory
docker compose up -d

Client:
apt install wireguard resolvconf
create connection on http://dmz:51821
download config
sudo mv ~/Downloads/benjymouse.conf /etc/wireguard/deepthot.conf
sudo wg-quick up deepthot

# Mail Server

Today I'm going to set up the mail server. Here are the goals:

1. Configure outgoing mail
2. Configure incoming mail
3. Configure an MUA
4. Configure spam handling
5. Configure DDOS handling

## Configuring outgoing mail

According to [ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/mail-postfix) postfix is the default MTA on ubuntu. I normally went
with exim, but I'm getting too old for that shit, so let's go with postfix.

Following the documentation above:

1. `sudo apt install postfix`
2. `sudo dpkg-reconfigure postfix` set stuff there that's you'd expect

If you want to actually like deliver mail, you better turn on spf at least, and probably dkim. Instructions on doing
that are provided by the every perky [linuxbabe](https://www.linuxbabe.com/mail-server/setting-up-dkim-and-spf)

All you need to do is add a txt record on your DNS reading
`@ txt v=spf1 mx ~all`
that's good enough to get most of your mail delivered.

To get the same for yourself:

```bash
sudo apt install postfix-policyd-spf-python
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/postfix/master.cf
policyd-spf  unix  -       n       n       -       0       spawn
    user=policyd-spf argv=/usr/bin/policyd-spf
EOF
sudo cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/postfix/main.cf
policyd-spf_time_limit = 3600
smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
   permit_mynetworks,
   permit_sasl_authenticated,
   reject_unauth_destination,
   check_policy_service unix:private/policyd-spf
EOF
sudo systemctl restart postfix
```

DKIM is better, here is how to set it up

```bash
sudo apt install opendkim opendkim-tools
sudo gpasswd -a postfix opendkim
sudo sed -i '/#LogWhy/aLogWhy yes' /etc/opendkim.conf
```

Actually there's more than I want to deal with here, so go to linuxbabe's site.

Meh, I'm tired of this, I really want mailu.

# Notes:

`kubectl patch challenge <challenge-name> -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers":null}}' --type=merge`  something like this can
work for about anything in
kubernetes. Assuming you can figure out what the target is.

https://k9scli.io/topics/install/ it's awesome haha

NOTE: remember [krew](https://krew.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user-guide/setup/install/) for managing kubectl files

If you have an extraneous dns server in your resolv.conf be sure to check what is in the network manager on your gui.
Duh

# New freeIPA install

My old freeIPA stopped working. This may have been due to the memory going bad on my HP, dunno. Anyway, the freeIPA I
have is running on a very old redhat install. I really wanna smack redhat, but they pull down the mirrors when a version
of the OS goes obsolete, that makes it
impossible to upgrade it to a newer version. Enough belly aching.

Getting IPA to work with synology: https://thomascfoulds.com/2023/05/13/synology-nfs-with-freeipa-ldap.html Haven't
tried
it yet, but that's what I'm going to try first. I recall doing most of this back in the day, why freeipa is missing
the schema for something as common as NFSv4 I have no idea. Seems dumb, I wonder why.

First thing is to define the schema for ldap to access nfsv4:

```bash
cat <<EOF | sudo tee $(echo /etc/dirsrv/slapd*)/schema/99nfs.ldif
dn: cn=schema
attributetype ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.250.1.61
NAME ( 'NFSv4Name')
DESC 'NFS version 4 Name'
EQUALITY caseIgnoreIA5Match
SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.26
SINGLE-VALUE)

attributetype ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.250.1.62
NAME ( 'GSSAuthName')
DESC 'RPCSEC GSS authenticated user name'
EQUALITY caseIgnoreIA5Match
SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.26)

#
# minimal information for NFSv4 access. used when local filesystem
# access is not permitted (nsswitch ldap calls fail), or when
# inetorgPerson is too much info.
#
objectclass ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.250.1.60 NAME 'NFSv4RemotePerson'
DESC 'NFS version4 person from remote NFSv4 Domain'
SUP top STRUCTURAL
MUST ( uidNumber $ gidNumber $ NFSv4Name )
MAY ( cn $ GSSAuthName $ description) )

#
# minimal information for NFSv4 access. used when local filesystem
# access is not permitted (nsswitch ldap calls fail), or when
# inetorgPerson is too much info.
#
objectclass ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.250.1.63 NAME 'NFSv4RemoteGroup'
DESC 'NFS version4 group from remote NFSv4 Domain'
SUP top STRUCTURAL
MUST ( gidNumber $ NFSv4Name )
MAY ( cn $ memberUid $ description) )
EOF
```

Still haven't made it work, *sigh*. nvm right now.

### Setting up sudo

```bash
ipa group-add --gid=110 admin
ipa group-add-member --groups=admins admin
```

This is I think hacky. The real way would be with sssd controlled with ipa, but I haven't found out how to do that yet.
